//@PURPOSE: Provide stream-based communication channel over TCP sockets.
//
//@CLASSES:
//  btlsos::TcpCbChannel: non-blocking non-timed channel over TCP/IPv4 sockets
//
//@SEE_ALSO:  btlsos_tcptimedcbacceptor btlsos_tcptimedcbconnector
//
//@SEE_ALSO:  btlsos_tcptimedcbchannel btlso_streamsocket

//
//@DESCRIPTION: This component provides a non-blocking communication channel
// over TCP/IPv4 sockets, 'btlsos::TcpCbChannel', that adheres to
// 'btlsc::TimedCbChannel' protocol.  Following the protocol, only operations
// without timeout are supported.  The channel uses user-installed event
// manager(s) to monitor an underlying socket for incoming events; two event
// managers can be installed in order to monitor for read and write events in
// different event managers.
//
// This channel uses a user-provided stream socket for IPv4 address family.
// Any concrete implementation that provides socket-like primitives is allowed.
// Common paradigms of acceptor and connector that produce channels directly is
// implemented (in other components) for both user convenience and completeness
// of the framework (see 'btlsos_tcptimedcbacceptor' and
// 'btlsos_tcptimedcbconnector' components).
//
///Thread Safety
///-------------
// Generally speaking, this channel is *not* *thread-safe*, meaning that any
// operation can not be called on *distinct instances* from different threads
// without any side-effects.  Thread-safety of this channel depends on whether
// or not given event manager(s), stream socket implementation, and memory
// allocator is *thread enabled (meaning that any operation can be invoked on
// the same instance from different threads).  If two channels share the same
// event manager, memory manager, and stream socket, then this two instances
// are thread safe if and only if the user-installed components are thread
// enabled.
//
///Performance
///-----------
// This channel is optimized for homogeneous operations, where homogeneity is
// consider within read or write domains in three different categories:
// buffered, non-buffered, and vectored.  Thus, it is advised that, for optimal
// performance, only one category within domain is used.
//
///Usage
///-----
//..
// See the {'btlsos_tcptimedcbacceptor'} component.

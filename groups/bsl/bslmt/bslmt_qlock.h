//@PURPOSE: Provide small, statically-initializable mutex lock.
//
//@CLASSES:
//       bslmt::QLock: Small, statically-initializable intra-process mutex
//  bslmt::QLockGuard: Automatic locking-unlocking of bslmt::QLock
//
//@SEE_ALSO: bslmt_mutex, bslmt_atomictypes, bslmt_lockguard, bslmt_once
//
//@DESCRIPTION: This component defines a portable and efficient lock for
// ensuring that only one thread at a time enters a specific "critical region"
// -- a section of code that accesses a shared resource -- 'bslmt::Qlock' and
// its associated 'bslmt::QLockGuard'.  The functionality of the 'bslmt::QLock'
// class overlaps those of the 'bslmt::Mutex' and 'bsls::SpinLock' classes, but
// with different usage and performance characteristics, as shown in the
// following grid:
//..
//                                    | QLock | Mutex | SpinLock
// -----------------------------------+-------+-------+---------
// Memory footprint                   | small | large | small
// Cost of construction/destruction   | cheap | costly| cheap
// Statically initializable           | yes   | no    | yes
// Speed at low contention            | fast  | fast  | fast
// Speed at high contention           | slow  | fast  | very slow
// Suitable for long critical regions | yes   | yes   | no
// Fair                               | yes   | no    | no
//..
// The performance trade-offs for a QLock are quite different than those for a
// conventional mutex.  QLocks are best suited for low-contention applications
// where large numbers of locks may be needed.  For example, a node-based data
// structure that needs a lock for each node can benefit from the small size
// and low initialization cost of a QLock compared to that of a conventional
// mutex.  A 'bslmt::Mutex' object cannot be initialized statically because
// some platforms (e.g., Windows XP) do not have a native
// statically-initializable mutex type.  A 'bslmt::QLock' object, in contrast
// is statically initializable on all platforms.
//
// The performance characteristics of a QLock are very similar to those of a
// SpinLock.  However, a QLock is much more suitable than a SpinLock for
// situations where the critical region is more than a few instructions long.
// Also, although QLocks are best for low-contention situations, they do not
// degrade nearly as badly as SpinLocks if there is a lot of contention for the
// lock.  They also use significantly fewer CPU cycles in high-contention
// situations than do SpinLocks.
//
// A unique characteristic of QLocks is that they are fair.  If there is
// contention for a lock, each thread is given the lock in the order in which
// it requested it.  Consequently, every thread competing for the lock will get
// a chance before any other thread can have a second turn; no thread is ever
// "starved" out of the critical region.  This fairness comes at a cost,
// however, in that the scheduler is given less leeway to schedule threads in
// the most efficient manner.
//
///The 'bslmt::QLockGuard' Class
///-----------------------------
// A 'bslmt::QLock' is different from other locking classes such as
// 'bslmt::Mutex' and 'bsls::SpinLock' in that it cannot be manipulated except
// through the auxiliary 'bslmt::QLockGuard' class.  The reason for this
// limited interface is that a QLock requires a small amount of additional
// storage for each thread that is holding or waiting for the lock.  The
// 'bslmt::QLockGuard' provides this extra storage efficiently on the stack.
//
// In typical usage, a 'bslmt::QLockGuard' is created as a local (stack)
// variable, acquires the lock in its constructor and releases the lock in its
// destructor.  If the lock is in use at construction time, then the current
// thread blocks until the lock becomes available.  Although the QLock itself
// is intended to be shared among multiple threads, the guard object must never
// be used by more than one thread at a time.  When multiple threads want to
// acquire the same QLock, each must use its own 'bslmt::QLockGuard' object.
//
// 'bslmt::QLockGuard' also provides the following manipulators typical of
// locking classes:
//..
//  void lock();    // Acquire the lock, waiting if necessary
//  int tryLock();  // Acquire the lock if possible.  Fail if lock is in use.
//  void unlock();  // Free the lock.
//..
// As with other types of mutexes, only one thread may hold the lock at a time.
// Other threads attempting to call 'lock' will block until the lock becomes
// available.  However, it is important to remember that the manipulators
// listed above are only pass-through operations on the shared 'bslmt::QLock'
// object.  In other words, upon return from calling 'lock' on a
// 'bslmt::QLockGuard' object, a thread has actually acquired the lock to the
// underlying 'bslmt::QLock'.
//
// Although it is only a proxy for the actual QLock, 'lock'/'unlock'/'tryLock'
// interface of 'bslmt::QLockGuard' allows it to be treated as though it were
// itself a lock.  In particular, it is possible to instantiate the
// 'bslmt::LockGuard' and 'bslmt::LockGuardUnlock' class templates using
// 'bslmt::QLockGuard'.  This layering of guard classes is useful for creating
// regions where the QLock is locked or unlocked.  For example, if a thread
// acquires a QLock and then needs to temporarily relinquish it, it could use a
// 'bslmt::LockGuardUnlock' as follows:
//..
//  void Node::update()
//  {
//     bslmt::QLockGuard qguard(&d_qlock);  // 'd_qlock' is a 'bslmt::QLock'.
//     readLunarState();
//     if (d_moonIsFull) {
//         // Free lock while we sleep
//         bslmt::LockGuardUnlock<bslmt::QLockGuard> unlock(&qguard)
//         sleep(TWENTY_FOUR_HOURS);
//     }
//     // Lock has been re-acquired
//     ...
//  }
//..
// The behavior is undefined if 'unlock' is invoked from a thread that did not
// successfully acquire the lock, or if 'lock' is called twice in a thread
// without an intervening call to 'unlock' (i.e., 'bslmt::QLockGuard' is
// non-recursive).
//
///Usage
///-----
// This section illustrates intended use of this component.
//
///Example 1: Using 'bslmt::QLock' to Implement a Thread-Safe Singleton
/// - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
// For this example, assume that we have the need to use the string "Hello"
// repeatedly in the form of an 'bsl::string' object.  Rather than construct
// the string each time we use it, it would be nice to have only one copy so
// that we can amortize the memory allocation and construction cost over all
// the uses of the string.  It is thus logical to have a single, static
// variable (a singleton) of type 'bsl::string' initialized with the value,
// "Hello".  Unfortunately, as this is a multithreaded application, there is
// the danger that more than one thread will attempt to initialize the
// singleton simultaneously, causing a memory leak at best and memory
// corruption at worse.  To solve this problem, we use a 'bslmt::QLock' to
// synchronize access to the singleton.
//
// We begin by wrapping the singleton in a function:
//..
//  const bsl::string& helloString()
//  {
//..
// This function defines two static variables, a pointer to the singleton, and
// a QLock to control access to the singleton.  Note that both of these
// variables are statically initialized, so there is no need for a run-time
// constructor and hence no danger of a race condition among threads.  The need
// for static initialization is the main reason we choose to use 'bslmt::QLock'
// over 'bslmt::Mutex':
//..
//      static const bsl::string *singletonPtr = 0;
//      static bslmt::QLock qlock = BSLMT_QLOCK_INITIALIZER;
//..
// Before checking the status of the singleton pointer, we must make sure that
// we are not accessing the pointer at the same time that some other thread is
// modifying the pointer.  We do this by acquiring the lock by constructing a
// 'bslmt::QLockGuard' object:
//..
//      bslmt::QLockGuard qlockGuard(&qlock);
//..
// Now we are inside the critical region.  If the pointer has not already been
// set, we can initialize the singleton knowing that no other thread is
// manipulating or accessing these variables at the same time.  Note that this
// critical region involves constructing a variable of type 'bsl::string'.
// This operation, while not ultra-expensive, is too lengthy for comfortably
// holding a spinlock.  Again, the characteristics of 'bslmt::QLock' are
// superior to the alternatives for this application.  (It is worth noting that
// the QLock concept was created specifically to permit this kind of one-time
// processing.  See also 'bslmt_once'.)
//..
//      if (! singletonPtr) {
//          static bsl::string singleton("Hello");
//          singletonPtr = &singleton;
//      }
//..
// Finally, we return a reference to the singleton.  The destructor for
// 'bslmt::QLockGuard' will automatically unlock the QLock and allow another
// thread into the critical region.
//..
//      return *singletonPtr;
//  }
//..
// The following test program shows how our singleton function can be called.
// Note that 'hello1' and 'hello2' have the same address, demonstrating that
// there was only one string created.
//..
//  int usageExample1()
//  {
//      const bsl::string EXPECTED("Hello");
//
//      const bsl::string& hello1 = helloString();
//      assert(hello1 == EXPECTED);
//
//      const bsl::string& hello2 = helloString();
//      assert(hello2  == EXPECTED);
//      assert(&hello2 == &hello1);
//
//      return 0;
//  }
//..

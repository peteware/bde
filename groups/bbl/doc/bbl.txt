@PURPOSE: Provide a foundation for component-based business logic development.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Business Library (bbl)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bbl' ("Basic Business Library") package group contains a
 package that provides a solution for computing day count and year fraction for
 various day-count conventions and a package for basic computations.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bbl' package group currently has 3 packages having 2 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the packages.
 The order of packages within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.

/Package Synopsis
/----------------
: 'bblb':
:      Provide basic computations.
:
: 'bbldc':
:      Provide day-count convention implementations.
:
: 'bblscm':
:      Provide versioning information for BDE library components.

/Package Overview
/----------------
 This section a brief introduction to the packages of the 'bbl' package group.
 See the respective Package Level documents for more details.

/'bblb'
/- - -
 The {'bblb'} package provides basic computations.  At the moment, this package
 contains a component, 'bblb_schedulegenerationutil', for schedule generation.

/'bbldc'
/- - - -
 The {'bbldc'} package provides day-count convention implementations, an
 enumeration-based set of dispatch components, and two abstract interfaces with
 parameterized adapters for the day-count convention implementations.

/'bblscm'
/ - - - -
 The {'bblscm'} package contains only two components, 'bblscm_version' and
 'bblscm_versiontag'.  The first of these components is included by every other
 component in 'bbl', and provides versioning information for the package group.
 Users may use the 'bblscm_version' facilities to query a particular 'bbl'
 library for its version information.  The second component defines macros that
 can be used for conditional-compilation based on 'bbl' version information.

@PURPOSE: Provide containers that support concurrent (multi-thread) access.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Development Library Concurrency Containers (bdlcc)

@SEE_ALSO: bdec, bcemt

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdlcc' package provides a set of containers that allow
 concurrent access and manipulation.  Components in this package are similar in
 *intent* to the corresponding 'bdlc' components, except that all operations
 which change the internal state of the containers are guaranteed to be atomic
 in the presence of multiple threads.

 Support for true multi-threading causes some significant interface changes
 when compared to the analogous 'bdlc' components.  A thread-safe collection
 cannot, in general, guarantee thread safety for its contained objects while
 still allowing access to those objects.  So, for instance, a canonical
 implementation of 'operator[]', yielding a reference to the contained object,
 would violate thread safety.  Therefore, thread-safe collections will, in
 general, return items *by* *value* rather than *by* *reference*.

 In addition, thread-aware collection components must make policy decisions
 regarding behavior of manipulators at the "edge conditions" when a collection
 is empty or full.  In a multi-threading context, it is often reasonable for a
 manipulator to block if it cannot complete a requested operation, and to wait
 for the collection state to change.  For instance, when called for an empty
 collection, 'bdlcc_Queue<T>::popFront()' will block and then wait until an
 element is available to satisfy the request.

 In general, components in 'bdlcc' support this blocking behavior where it
 makes sense.  Refer to the individual component documentation to understand
 how this general principle is carried out in specific components.

/Component Overview
/------------------
 This section provides a brief introduction to some of the components of the
 'bdlcc' package.  Full details are available in the documentation of each
 component.

/'bdlcc_objectcatalog'
/ - - - - - - - - - -
 The {'bdlcc_objectcatalog'} component provides a thread-safe, indexable
 catalog of object.  Clients instantiate a template class,
 'bdlcc_ObjectCatalog<T>', where type 'T' is the data type of elements that the
 catalog will hold.  Type 'T' must be defined to be copyable either by a copy
 constructor or by 'T::operator=()'; class 'bdlcc_ObjectCatalog' places no
 additional requirements on 'T'.

 When clients add elements to a 'bdlcc_ObjectCatalog', the 'add' method returns
 a handle which can be used to refer to the element until the element is
 'remove'd.  Addition is not guaranteed to succeed and the return vaslue must
 be checked.  An element can be accessed through its handle by using the 'find'
 function and passing a buffer for holding the value.  Passing a null buffer
 can be used for testing whether the handle is still valid (i.e., refers to an
 element that has not yet been removed from the catalog).

 The 'bdlcc_ObjectCatalog' is designed to support direct access to individual
 queued elements based upon their 'Handle'.  This means that 'bdlcc_Catalog'
 can support frequent additions and removals more efficiently than traditional
 queue structures designed for sequential access.

/'bdlcc_pool'
/- - - - - -
 The {'bdlcc_pool'} component provides a thread-safe memory pool of objects
 from a parameterized type 'T'.  Clients instantiate a 'bdlcc_ObjectPool<T>'
 where the type 'T' has no requirements.  The pool owns the memory and objects
 it contains.  An object pool manages creation of its objects via a
 user-installed functor (given to the pool constructor), and provides automatic
 destruction of its objects either upon the 'destroyObject' method, or upon the
 pool destruction.  An object can be obtained from the pool by calling the
 'getObject' method, and can be released back to the pool for further use
 within 'getObject' by calling the 'releaseObject' method.

 An object pool is most useful when the objects are equivalent (i.e., any
 object in the pool can be used to satisfy an object request) and object
 creation is potentially expensive.  Pooling enables the object to be reused at
 a later time without going through destruction and re-creation.  For instance,
 the object constructor may get access to some resource (e.g., a connection)
 and the resource may remain valid after several uses and thus can be reused.

/'bdlcc_queue'
/- - - - - - -
 The {'bdlcc_queue'} component provides an in-place, indexable, double-ended
 queue.  Clients instantiate a template class, 'bdlcc_Queue<T>', where type 'T'
 is the data type of elements that the queue will hold.  Type 'T' must be
 defined to be copyable either by a copy constructor or by 'T::operator=()';
 class 'bdlcc_Queue' Places no additional requirements on 'T'.

/'bdlcc_timequeue'
/ - - - - - - - -
 The {'bdlcc_timequeue'} component provides an in-place, indexable queue,
 managed in time order.  Clients instantiate a template class,
 'bdlcc_TimeQueue<T>', where type 'T' is the data type of elements that the
 queue will hold.  Type 'T' must be defined to be copyable either by a copy
 constructor or by 'T::operator=()'; class 'bdlcc_TimeQueue' places no
 additional requirements on 'T'.

 When clients add elements to a 'bdlcc_TimeQueue', they provide both the
 element 'T' to be added and a time value, of type 'bdet_TimeInterval'.
 Elements can be extracted individually in time order using the overloaded
 'popFront()' member functions; a block of elements can also be popped in a
 single operation, 'popLE()', which pops all elements before a given time
 value.

 The 'bdlcc_TimeQueue' class template supports direct access to individual
 queued elements based upon their 'Handle'.  This means that 'bdlcc_TimeQueue'
 can support frequent additions and removals more efficiently than traditional
 queue structures designed for sequential access.

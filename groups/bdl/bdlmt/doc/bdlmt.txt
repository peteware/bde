@PURPOSE: Provides thread pools and event schedulers.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Development Library Multi Thread (bdlmt)

@SEE_ALSO: bdlcc

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdlmt' ("Basic Development Library Multi Thread") package
 provides components for creating and managing thread pools, and components for
 scheduling (time-based) events.

 A "thread pool" is a collection of processor threads that are managed
 together and used interchangeably to support user requests.  The
 'bdlmt_threadpool' component allows clients to configure the pool so that it
 grows and shrinks according to user demand, manage thread availability, and
 schedule client "jobs" to be run independently as threads in the pool become
 available.  It does this by placing client requests on an internal job
 queue, and controlling multiple threads as they remove jobs from the queue
 and execute them.

 A "multi-queue thread pool" defines a dynamic, configurable pool of queues,
 each of which is processed by a thread in a thread pool, such that elements
 on a given queue are processed serially, regardless of which thread is
 processing the queue at a given time.  In addition to the ability to create
 and delete queues, clients are able to tune the underlying thread pool.

 A "timer-event scheduler" defines a thread-safe event scheduler.  It
 provides methods to schedule and cancel recurring and non-recurring events
 (also referred to as clock).  The callbacks are processed by a separate
 thread (called dispatcher thread).

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bdlmt' package currently has 7 components having 2 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
 The order of components within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.

/Generic Overview of Thread Pools
/--------------------------------
 At the current time, this generic overview applies only to the
 'bdlmt_MultipriorityThreadPool'.  The plan is for other threadpools to move
 to this model at a later date.

 As Figure 1 illustrates, a threadpool allows its clients to enqueue units of
 work to be processed concurrently in multiple threads.  Each work item, or
 "job", consists of a function along with the address of its associated input
 data.  When executed, this address is supplied to the function as its only
 argument; note that this function must have external linkage and return
 'void':
..
  extern "C" void job(void *);     // Idiomatic C-style function signature
..
 Alternatively both the function and its data can be encapsulated and
 supplied in the form of an (invokable) function object, or "functor", taking
 no arguments and returning 'void'.

 In addition to enqueuing jobs, a thread pool must supply primitive control
 functionality such as creating and destroying worker threads, enabling and
 disabling the enqueuing of new jobs, causing the queue to block until there
 are no pending jobs, and removing (i.e., canceling) all pending (i.e., not
 yet running) jobs.  Different kinds of threadpools will provide different
 functionality and/or performance characteristics, corresponding those of the
 underlying thread-enabled ('bdlcc') queue -- e.g., (limited-capacity)
 'FixedQueue', (heap-based) 'PriorityQueue', and (array-based)
 'MultipriorityQueue'.  Nonetheless, each of the threadpool objects in 'bdlmt'
 should provide a suite of input and control operations that are consistent
 in both name and behavior across the 'bdlmt' package.

 Due to the intricate nature of threadpools, it is easy to convolve behaviors
 in subtly different ways for functions having the same name.  Consider, for
 example, the method 'void drainJobs()', the basic functionality of which is
 to 'block' the caller until all of the pending jobs complete (i.e., the
 queue is empty and all worker threads are idle).  Should 'drainJobs()' also
 leave the queue in the disabled state?  Even if that is a common usage
 pattern, it is often useful to start with simple, orthogonal behaviors, and
 if needed, define more complex behaviors in terms of them.

 In the case of a thread pool, it is instructive to break the functionality
 into three categories of operations relative to the underlying queue: Front,
 Middle, and Back.  At the back of the queue (refer to Figure 1), we need to
 enable/disable clients from adding work items.  Enabling or disabling the
 queue does not affect the items already in the queue [Middle], nor any
 worker threads processing these items [Front].

 In the middle of the queue, we have two operations that result in purging
 all pending items in the queue: 'drainJobs()' and 'removeJobs()' If we
 invoke 'removeJobs()', then all currently pending (i.e., not started) work
 items will be removed (i.e., canceled).  During this process, clients
 attempting to add work items [Back] will block, but their eventual success
 or failure, (which is based solely on whether the queue is enabled or
 disabled) is not affected.  Note that jobs that are already in progress
 [Front] are also unaffected.  Similarly, invoking our orthogonal
 'drainJobs()' method will block enqueuing clients until all pending jobs
 have completed, but will not affect the enabledness of the thread pool
 [Back], nor the processing of work items [Front].

 Finally we come to the front of the queue, which addresses the processing of
 jobs.  A (typically fixed) number of worker threads is specified at
 construction.  The thread pool "wakes up" in an enabled state, but without
 having created the worker threads.  Invoking the 'startThreads()' method
 attempts to create these threads (unless they are already created).  The
 'startThreads()' method returns 0 if all of these threads are started, and a
 non-zero value otherwise (in which case none of the worker threads are
 started).  Redundant calls to 'startThreads()' do nothing and return zero.
 Invoking 'stopThreads()' destroys each worker thread (after it completes any
 current job).  Note that the current contents of the queue [Middle], and the
 ability to enqueue new jobs [Back] are not affected.

 Whether or not started threads should be pulling jobs from the queue and
 processing them is not necessarily the same as having the user-specified
 number of worker threads created.  In addition to being *enabled* and
 *started* let's consider one more possible state, *suspended*.  If a thread
 pool is in the *suspended* state, then even when it is in the *started*
 state, it will not attempt to pop jobs from the queue and execute them.

 A created threadpool will be created enabled, not suspended, and not
 started.  All three of these qualities are orthogonal and any one of them
 can be changed at any time.

 The vast majority of users will be uninterested in both the 'suspend' and
 'disable' features, so it is imperative that newly created threadpools be
 both non-suspended and enabled so users can remain blissfully ignorant of
 them.  It is also important the first usage examples, if not all of them,
 omit use of these features to minimize learning time for the typical user.

 To conclude this generic overview, we note that there is one common usage
 that, although not minimal, arguably deserves to be a method of every thread
 pool class: 'void shutdown()'.  This method is best described as a
 composition of the simple, orthogonal functions described above.  In order
 to shut down a thread pool, we need to first disable the enqueuing of any
 additional jobs, then remove all of the pending work items, and finally stop
 all of the active threads:
..
  void shutdown()
  {
      disableQueue();
      removeJobs();
      stopThreads();
  }
..
 By making sure that our initial operations are simple and orthogonal, we can
 ensure that the precise meaning of more complex operations is kept clear.

/Synchronous Signals on Unix
/---------------------------
 A thread pool ensures that, on Unix platforms, all the threads in the pool
 block all asynchronous signals.  Specifically all the signals, except the
 following synchronous signals are blocked.
..
  SIGBUS
  SIGFPE
  SIGILL
  SIGSEGV
  SIGSYS
  SIGABRT
  SIGTRAP
  SIGIOT
..

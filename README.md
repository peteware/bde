Basic Build Instructions
========================

BDE uses a build system based on [waf](https://github.com/waf-project/waf), which is
located in the [BDE Tools](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools/)
repository. This build system must be set up before being used:

1. Make sure that python 2.6 - 2.7 are installed on the system.
2. Download [BDE Tools](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools/) and add the
   path `<bde_tools_repo_root>/bin` to the system `PATH` environment
   variable. Make sure the first `waf` command found in `PATH` is a script from that path.

Once the waf based build system has been set up. The following commands can be
used to configure and build the BDE repository:

1. From the root of this source repository, run:

   ```shell
   waf configure
   ```

2. To build the libraries, but not the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   waf build
   ```

   To also build the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   waf build --test build
   ```

   To build and run the test drivers, run:

   ```shell
   waf build --test run
   ```

For more details on building the BDE repository, please see the
[Quick Start Guide](http://github.com/bloomberg/bde/wiki/Getting-Started).
